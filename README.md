# Welcome to Squirrel Jokes!

This is a riff off of the jokes app from the [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs) tutorial. My sister is a speech language pathologist and I am hoping she can use this with her students. This app is live [here](https://remix-jokes-riff.herokuapp.com/).

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
